<h1 style="text-align: center;">18 Landseer Street</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Let the Nightmare Begin.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
You awaken in your bedroom. The house is silent, 
your parents have already left for work. You get out of bed and go downstairs to make breakfast and begin your day.<br> 
<br>After you make your breakfast you head back upstairs to eat your breakfast in your bed while watching TV.<br> 
You turn on the TV and there is an Emergency Broadcast Alert on the screen. You try to change the channel, only to find the same Emergency Broadcast Alert blanketing every channel. 
<br>You stay on the channel and wait to see what the emergency is.<br>
<br>“This is an Emergency Broadcast Alert; regular television scheduling has ceased.<br> 
This is an Emergency Broadcast Alert, the recently deceased have risen from the dead. Remain in your own home and do not let anyone enter.<br>
I repeat remain in your own home and do not let anyone enter. This is not a drill. News is scarce however the British Government have confirmed that a deadly virus has broken out across Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Any recently deceased humans have risen from the dead and are attacking the living. The government advise the public to remain in their own homes and to barricade themselves in until help arrives. Do not leave your house under any circumstances and do not draw any attention to your residence. It is advised to gather all food and water and to remain in one room together. Avoid making loud sounds that may attract others and keep all lights off. Ration food and water if possible and continue to watch for the latest updates.”<br>
<br>"In the event you encounter one of these "Zombies" YOU must destroy the brain and YOU must not get bitten!"<br>
<br>The TV continues to repeat the message on a loop. 
Immediately your first thoughts are your family. You try to ring your Mum, straight to voicemail. You try to ring your Dad, straight to voicemail. The phonelines are jammed from everyone calling. You go onto find my iPhone and see that both your parents last known location was at each of their jobs. Your Dads location was last known 40 minutes ago. Your Mums location was last known 1 hour ago. You begin to think what you should do.<br> 
<br>Should you go and try get them and bring them back to the house where it is safe? 
<br>Should you wait and see if they come home? 
<br>What does it look like outside?<br>
<br>You immediately go to your upstairs window and look out. You can’t see much but your street looks unaffected, however in the distance you can see a few smoke plumes towards the town. Bangor is a relatively small town that resides 14 miles outside of Belfast. 
<br>You ponder your options and weigh out the pros and cons.<br>
<br>Pros of staying – you are safe for the time being, you have food and water, you have shelter.<br>
Cons of staying – you are alone, you don’t know if your family is safe, you don’t know if your friends are safe.<br>
Pros of leaving – you may find your parents, you may find your friends, you may find more supplies.<br>
Cons of leaving – you may not find your parents, you may not find your friends, the chances of running into a hostile person and or a zombie are greatly increased, someone might come looking for your whenever you leave.<br>
<br>With these options in mind, you decide to look at your social media. Opening Facebook Messenger, you are bombarded with notifications from the big group chat. You had muted it the night before, smart move. Based on what you have read most of your friends are together in at 18 Landseer Street. You recognise the address, it’s your friend Tess’s University House. They have said that the area is safe and that I am welcome to seek refuge there. Now you have the option of trying to get from Bangor to Belfast. 
The main priority is to find your parents however videos on Social Media suggest Bangor is in ruins. What do you do? Get in the car and try and find your parents? Get to safety with your friends? Stay put? Time to decide…
