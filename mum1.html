<h1 style="text-align: center;">18 Landseer Street</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Finding Mum.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    You set off and drive cautiously as your car is obviously making a noticeable amount of noise.<br>
    This is the first time you’ve seen the extend of the damage to your local estate.<br> 
    You notice people peeking out of their blinds as you drive past, some even trying to signal you.<br>
    There’s no time you need to find your parents. The closer you get towards the nursing home you see a slew<br>
    of bodies in the streets along with a few zombies who try and chase the car, but they give up relatively easy.<br>
    About a mile from the nursing home, you have the bright idea to turn your engine off and let the car roll the<br>
    rest of way to attract less attention. Approaching the nursing home, you notice there is a hoard of zombies,<br> 
    you now begin to accept that your mother is gone. You can’t stop and process it there’s no time.<br>
    Suddenly there is a radio transmission being broadcasted over your favourite station. “Bangor has been completely<br>
    overrun with zombies, AVOID AT ALL COSTS”.<br> You begin to sob behind the wheel and try and decide whether or not to go looking for your dad.
